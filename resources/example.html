			This week, I started a new method of cataloguing my weekly documentation. Instead of typing out long quasi-essays of my activities, I will simply demonstrate the code that I am learning, with links to the sources, and added blurbs of other stuff that I have learned, for example a new photoshop technique.

			Today, I am learning more about XHTML, on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzW9zD5yZoE&index=32&list=PL03660F3C49352556" target="_blank">the New Boston's</a> YouTube channel. Today is about pseudo-elements. Pseudo-elements, or p-elements are things within an element that can be selected in CSS, for example, the first letter in a sentence or the first line...this allows for just a little more decoration or variance on a webpage, if used correctly.
